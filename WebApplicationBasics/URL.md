- Scheme

is the protocol used to access the website.

- User

Some URLs can include a user’s login details (usually a username) for sites that require authentication.
. However, it’s rare nowadays because putting login details in the URL isn’t very safe

- Host/Domain

it tells you which website you’re accessing. 
From a security standpoint, look for domain names that appear almost like real ones but have small differences (this is called typosquatting).

- Port

The port number helps direct your browser to the right service on the web server.
It’s like telling the server which doorway to use for communication. 

- Path

The path points to the specific file or page on the server that you’re trying to access.

- Query String

 starts with a question mark (?). used for things like search terms

- Fragment

starts with a hash symbol (#). helps point to a specific section of a webpage—like jumping directly to a particular heading or table.
